## Obstacle Detector
* A Deep Learning based IOT project which identifies 80 different objects (YOLO) using the Pi camera, calculates distance for humans (Haar) and 
  reads out the type of object and distance for humans. Written in Python, using OpenCV.


## [Count Number of Fingers using Sign Language](https://github.com/dixithak/StaticHandGesture)
* A CNN (Machine learning) was developed which classifies images according to the dataset available, the number representing the gesture will 
be shown. This will be further used for Sign Language translation. Written in python, using Tensorflow and Keras with Google Colabs.


## [Obstacle Detector for the blind](https://github.com/dixithak/Obstacle_Detector)
* An obstacle detector which alerts the person walking if there is an obstacle in the specified range thereby preventing them from running into the obstacle. 
* Hardware components :Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic sensor, Peizo Buzzer
* Written in C++ 


## [Open Library website](https://github.com/dixithak/OpenLibrary_web)
* A website where one can find diverse genres for books. Contains a small description for the book, pdf and links to buy the books online.
* Written in HTML and CSS


## [Open Library App](https://github.com/dixithak/OpenLibrary_app)
* An Android app using Android Studio was built
* JAVA and XML
