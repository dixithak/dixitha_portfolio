# [OBSTACLE DETECTOR]
* A Deep Learning based IOT project which identifies 80 different objects (YOLO) using the Pi camera, calculates distance for humans (Haar) and 
  reads out the type of object and distance for humans. Written in Python, using OpenCV.

# [Count Number of Fingers using Sign Language](https://github.com/dixithak/StaticHandGesture)
* A CNN (Machine learning) was developed which classifies images according to the dataset available, the number representing the gesture will 
be shown. This will be further used for Sign Language translation. Written in python, using Tensorflow and Keras with Google Colabs.
